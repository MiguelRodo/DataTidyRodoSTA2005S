\title{Air Quality Dataset from South African Urban Areas}
\format{
A data frame with 150 rows and 9 variables:
\describe{
\item{particulate_matter}{Numeric. Fine particulate matter concentration (µg/m³). Response variable.}
\item{traffic_density}{Integer. Number of vehicles per hour in the area.}
\item{industrial_activity}{Ordered factor. Level of industrial activity near the monitoring station. Levels: "None" < "Low" < "Moderate" < "High".}
\item{temperature}{Numeric. Average ambient temperature (°C).}
\item{humidity}{Numeric. Average relative humidity (\%).}
\item{wind_speed}{Numeric. Average wind speed (m/s).}
\item{day_of_week}{Ordered factor. Day of the week. Levels: "Monday" < "Tuesday" < "Wednesday" < "Thursday" < "Friday" < "Saturday" < "Sunday".}
\item{holiday}{Factor. Whether the day is a public holiday. Levels: "No", "Yes".}
\item{urban_greenery}{Numeric. Percentage of area covered by green spaces.}

\description{
This dataset contains measurements of particulate matter and associated environmental variables collected from 150 monitoring stations across various cities in South Africa. It is intended for use in analyzing the factors influencing air quality to inform urban planning and public health strategies.
}
\details{
The dataset was generated for educational purposes to simulate realistic air quality data influenced by various environmental and human factors. It includes both continuous and categorical variables, some of which are ordinal (e.g., \code{industrial_activity} and \code{day_of_week}).
